        One of the biggest challenges we face in Nigeria is the intermittency of
        power, the unreliable national grid and the energy deficit across the
        value chain. Nigerians have long used diesel generators and have gotten
        comfortable with them. UNAB global energy limited intends to solve this
        by accelerating the adoption of renewable energy solutions. Prioritising
        consumer education and providing resources that enable a seamless
        conversion that will help in creating brand awareness and product
        adoption will determine our success.
